Welcome. I am a frontend developer. Working with HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Webpack, ReactJS and NextJS. Now, I include the Astro Framework and tailwind as a CSS's framework.

I am also a Civil Engineer by profession and a Geek at heart, I've worked in the construction field for 6 years, however, I decided to make a change in my life in search of great opportunities. Three years ago I made the decision to venture into the world of software development, a few weeks later, I fell in love with web development, specifically the path as a Frontend Developer.

In this new role and challenge in my life, I have carried out personal projects, mainly with technologies such as JavaScript, ReactJS and NextJS. Technology is my passion and the path that I have decided to turn into my job and hobby. I would love to be able to work on projects whose stack involves React to deepen and contribute my knowledge in the continuous development of the startup that creates new talent.
